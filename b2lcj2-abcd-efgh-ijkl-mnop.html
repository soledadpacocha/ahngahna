Can someone help me please Right, so the other day my best friend said he could give me his dota 2 key for £15. I payed him and he just stole my money and gave me the most generic key ever, ABCD-EFGH-IJKL-MNOP. I got my money back from him but I've been waiting for a DOTA 2 key for 5 years ( me and 2 friends heard that DOTA 2 was in the making (which it wasn't at the time)). If you've got any keys then PLEASE can you at least think about the guy whining for a key on reddit. Thanks anyways.

Trying to create a script that creates five folders: ABCD EFGH IJKL MNOP QRST UVWX YZ and then moves all files and folders that start with the letters in those folders into those folders without moving those folders themselves. So, a file named Admin.ps1 would be moved into ABCD and a folder named "Admin_Files" would be moved into ABCD and so forth. I can get as far as creating the folders but am struggling with the move part and excluding the folders themselves. I got about 400, four letter words that I need to search through every couple of seconds. I need to do search for about 30 words every time I run it. So basically I need to check if those 30 words are contained in the 400. The 400 words are static and they don't change. Is it better to do a simple string search where I have a hidden element with the string "ABCD EFGH IJKL MNOP" or make an array like arr = "ABCD","EFGH","IJKL" MNOP" and then iterate through that. Or is there a 3rd, bette. The objective of this code is to print the contents of 'array' like this: abcd efgh ijkl mnop qrst The outer loop should print the newline while the inner loop prints the characters in each string. The outer loop has a counter of 5, while the inner a counter of 4. This is what displays: abcdefghijkl Another issue is that I get a segmentation fault when I try to print the newline. I commented those lines out for now. Here is my code. bits 64 global. abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop. Here's some Python test code: l = chr(i) for i in range(ord('A'), ord('Z') + 1) expected = 'A', 'B', 'AB', 'C', 'D', 'CD', 'ABCD', 'E', 'F', 'EF', 'G', 'H', 'GH', 'EFGH', 'ABCDEFGH', 'I', 'J', 'IJ', 'K', 'L', 'KL', 'IJKL', 'M', 'N', 'MN', 'O', 'P', 'OP', 'MNOP', 'IJKLMNOP', 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP', ex = for el in expected: Kind of a long post! Hoping for some assistance with Windows NLB and changing my NICs on ESXi hosts. I know the answer is get rid of Windows NLB but that isn't currently an option. I've messed with this for a bit and I'm not just quite getting things to work as expected. This is sort of a networking/systems crossover but figure I'd toss it out here. We run ADFS with WAP to authenticate our users both externally and internally to various services including 365, GAPPs and a few other things. working on an led display with the following code: void displayString(char s) { for (int i = 0; ilt=strlen(s); i++) { displayChar(s i ); } } void loop() { static String str; buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin); if (buttonState != lastButtonState) { if (buttonState == HIGH) { buttonPushCounter++; Serial.println(str); Serial.print("number of button pushes:. Hi reddit, For a web project, i'm trying to write a very simple function that display a specific result based on the number written in the user input field. The user can choose in a dropdown menu and then, the user can input a number in the "fieldname2" field. This code works actually pretty well, but for my project, I would have to repeat almost 500 "if" function for each switch case as the range could go up to 500000. I'm sure there is an easier solution for this. 
Let us say you have an image with a certain number of pixels X. Is there a program that could generate a series of images with varying row lengths from X by 1 to 1 by X. For example, let us say you had a small 4 by 4 image. This image has sixteen pixels. I would want the program to generate 16 images. The first would be 16 pixels wide, and one pixel tall. The last would be 1 pixel wide and 16 pixels tall. If there are unfilled rows, they would just be filled in with an arbitrary color.

Not all of the GiftCodes have been assigned a PersonID yet. There's also a primary key autonumber and some other irrelevant fields.
