Hey everyone! Flight 1 is doing a sale on their ifly 737 and as it comes with a very complete pack which includes the 600/700/800/900/BBJ and different engine options. So my question is, had Ifly modelled all the different flight parameters (engine parameters and FDE) from each single version or had they opted to model just one (probably the 800/900 one) and implemented those characteristics in all the variants?

Trying to choose between these two aircraft for P3D. Price isn't an issue, I can afford to buy either. The key thing for me is performance. My rig is pretty weak by this sub-reddits' standards; gt FX-8320 @ 3.5Ghz, R9-280x 3GB, Asus M5A97 R2.0 ATX AM3+, 8GB Corsair Vengance RAM. I want to be able to fly the plane without reducing my graphics to potato quality.

I will be upgrading from FSX:SE to P3Dv4 soon. However, i will only have enough money leftover to buy one good aircraft, and I cannot decide which would be best. Im looking for a well made short to medium range airliner, particularly between the tfdi 717, ifly 737, and the PMDG ngx. I originally had my mind set on the ifly 737 due to its price and the number of models included. Just recently I started looking at the PMDG NGX due to its price being almost the same. I've never had a pmdg plane. Just upgraded from fsx to P3D and very much enjoying the experience with the A320 (thank you Aerosoft!). However, I have the lack of a 737 to contend with. I had the PMDG for fsx, and am deliberating wether to buy it again, or get the ifly 737. Does anyone have any experience with the latter 
Hey everyone, I know this topic has been beaten to death I've the years, but I can't find any posts from recent on the topic. I'm looking to take the plunge into the Airbus 320 family and am looking to purchase a pay ware with full function FMC as well as good flight dynamic/graphics. I've been flying the Ifly 737 for a year or two now and I feel it's time to expand my horizons. Thanks. Finally, after a few weeks of work, this one is finished. PMDG versus iFly. Both great planes, in my opinion the NGX has a better quality, but also a higher. I’ve come to the realisation that my laptop, yes laptop :/, cannot run aircraft such at the PMDG 737 or even the ifly 737, it’s not really for gaming, but hey ho I’ll stick with it because I love to sim. Anyway, I know it’s sad, but I’d like to make the default 737 more realistic visually by making the cockpit the same shade of grey as the PMDG has and not the bright grey that it’s got now. Is there any way of changing the shade of grey, if not that’s understandable, just wondering.

First off i am more of a GA flyer, i have the Carenado B200, SR22, Cessna 195 bush, and the A2A B-17, Cessna 172, Piper Cub and P-51. I have been thinking of getting a payware 737 because sometimes i like to fly jets and would like to make it more realistic then the stock 737. I have been doing a little research and i am thinking of the ifly 737, one reason is my system isn't a super computer and i don't know if i'm ready for the PMDG. So i guess what i want to know., is the ifly a good value. IFly 737-800. 76 likes. iFly 737-800. Hi guys, I have been thinking about getting X-plane 10, but I am not sure on how well it will run performance wise when using complex addon aircraft. Because of this, I have considered getting the X-plane 10 Regional edition, rather than getting the global edition, so I can try X-plane without investing around double the money. I have a few questions regarding X-plane: 1) Are there any other places that sell x-plane 10 regional edition other than Amazon? I have checked local stores online. iFly Jets - The 737NG for FSX (2011) PC данную раздачу вы сможете скачать бесплатно через торрент.

I had the PMDG NGX way back when for FSX, but haven't used it in many many years. Could someone give me an objective comparison? Not interested in anyone's loyalties to any particular dev, just the metits of each aircraft. Also, are iFly amp PMDG the only decent players? Or does the Milviz/captainsim etc come close? Of particular interest is how usable they are in VR, as i exclusively use a Oculus Rift for flightsim. Recent. I have been looking around for the 737 Payware but it is very expensive and I'm not ready to put that much money in yet. Is there any discounts you guys know about or cheaper prices?

This has definitely been talked about in the past, but I'd like to see how it is now. One thing I've wanted for a little while now is the PMDG 737 NGX. The only thing stopping me at the moment however is the price - As a full-time college student, I just cannot afford it! I'm against piracy of any form, so that's also out. Has there ever been a sale on the aircraft ever? Or have PMDG and Aerosoft when they re-publish it kept the price the same ever since day 1? Another option I have is gettin. Well, after weeks of debating back and forwards with my wallet about purchasing even more FS add-ons, I finally took the plunge last night and put my hand in my pocket for the iFly 737.All I can say is.WOW.I just cant believe how good this bird is.If anyone is still sitting on the fence ok lads! I mainly play military flight sims but seeing all these cools shots of you guys flying around the world in passenger jets and landing in cool locations convinced me I need to get in on this. So FSX was 50% on Steam.so what should I do? My main goal is to fly some little passenger jet and make it look good doing it. So I guess I am after; - A fun jet to learn. I play study sims in DCS so I don't mind something a little complex. Maybe there is a middle of the road type jet I could. To provide the air transportation industry with staff travel operations as a unique managed-service, supported by the best-in-class technology. I own the 777 for fsx and now I use P3D. Just to make myself feel better, who has also had to repurchase their pmdg planes just because of transitioning to P3D? (I do not intend to start a rant against pmdg's pricing policy, just want to see what others did when they were in this situation). Здравствуйте. Появилась недавно проблема с ifly 737. При работе АП независимо на эшелоне или на круге. Alright i should start with a little back story. I have been flying flight sims since the Micro Prose F-117 Stealth Fighter days (nothing like busting a tank farm on a DX66). However since then i have been kind of hit or miss with keeping up with the modern sims. Have played all the ones worth mentioning but never more then crashing a few planes into the ground now and then. Well now i want to take this a little more seriously! I have prepar3d and a VERY well equiped gaming computer. Introduction. There have been two major releases of 737 models this year- PMDG and iFLY and both have brought out FSX versions of their 737NG families. 
All of their products that I've looked at are FSX only, which is really unfortunate since I only buy products now that are P3D compatible as I plan on making the switch soon (as soon as performance issues and crashes start to annoy me enough). Their website also looks like it hasn't been updated since 1998, so there's FSX - P3D - iFly Jets, Boeing 737/747 (Aircraft) » Самолёты и вертолёты для FS2004, FSX, P3D » Скачать торрент :: GOSTRACKER.XYZ. I've been on the fence about moving to P3D for a while now, but a weird bug in FSX just pushed me over the edge. I'm currently downloading P3D V.3 now, and I was wondering if I could put default FSX planes in there since the P3D default doesn't include any tubeliners (and I'm still waiting on some of my addons to be P3D compatible). I haven't been able to find anything online, but for the time being, are there any issues with putting FSX default planes Home 737 Download iFly 737NG New Version #FSX Download iFly 737NG New Version #FSX Nicola Ananda 7:20:00 PM.
